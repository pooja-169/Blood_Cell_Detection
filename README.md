**Overview**

This project focuses on detecting and classifying three types of blood cells: Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs), and Platelets. The research involves a comparative analysis of multiple YOLO models (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10) to determine the most effective model for blood cell detection.

**
The dataset used for this project was sourced from:Blood Cell Detection Dataset

**Methodology**

Implemented and trained YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10 for blood cell detection.

Evaluated the models based on mAP50, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conducted an in-depth comparative analysis to identify the most effective model for detecting RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets.

**Results**

Best performing model: YOLOv5 achieved the highest mAP50 of 93.5%.

Precision scores:

RBCs: 85.1% (best model)

WBCs: 98.6% (best model)

Platelets: 88.8% (best model)
